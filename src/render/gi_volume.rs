// HOW IT WORKS
// render the world from 3 orthographic cameras
// if the angle to the camera with the triangle is good enough, rasterize it to the volume 
// set opacity to 1, color to the albedo at that point * shadow
// generate mipmaps
// pass the volume texture(s)? to the 

// single pass for the orthographic pass
